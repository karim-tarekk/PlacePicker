# PlacePicker

PlacePicker is a React-based web application that allows users to explore and select from a curated list of famous places to visit. With a user-friendly interface, the application enables users to indicate their interest in various places and provides the flexibility to manage their selections. The integration of a backend and REST API ensures efficient data handling, while the default sorting mechanism organizes places based on the user's location and proximity to nearby attractions.

## Features

- **Explore Famous Places:** Browse through a diverse collection of well-known tourist destinations.
- **Select and Deselect:** Easily mark places you're interested in visiting and remove them from your list as needed.
- **Backend Integration:** Utilizes a backend server and REST API for seamless data management.
- **Location-Based Sorting:** Automatically sorts places based on the user's current location, highlighting nearby attractions.
